               <p>Clicking on "relations" displays related text from Whitman's early manuscripts and notebooks, along with links to transcriptions. The red and blue lines offer a visualization of the relations. The blue line corresponds to the number of related manuscripts or notebooks. The red line corresponds to the total number of related text segments from those manuscripts and notebooks. For more about how we have determined relations, see our

Repeated titles and untitled poems have been assigned a number in brackets. The poems also include their eventual (1881) titles in parentheses. Early manuscripts and notebooks that relate to some part of the preface or poem, or to the work as a whole, are linked in the box, along with a certainty (low or high) indicating how sure we are about the relation.</p>
