                <p class="tei_p">Whitman registered the copyright for the 1855 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in the clerk's office of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on May 15, 1855.<span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n6 tei_note_type_authorial note" id="n6"><span>Copyright was not centralized at the Library of Congress until 1870. For editions of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> published after that date, Whitman corresponded with Ainsworth Spofford, Librarian of Congress, about copyright registration. See Nierman and "Overview." </span></span> Copyright on the book was renewed on March 15, 1883, for fourteen additional years.<span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n7 tei_note_type_authorial note" id="n7"><span>Myerson, 18.

                <p class="tei_p">In all but three of the known surviving copies of the 1855 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, the copyright notice is printed in two lines on the verso of the title page. One Williams College copy has a blank copyright page; two other copies, now at the University of Virginia and the Providence Athenæum, have the copyright notice written in Whitman's hand.<span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n3 tei_note_type_authorial note" id="n3"><span>See <a href="../../bibliography/index.html#WC_02" class="internal_link">WC_02</a>, <a href="../../bibliography/index.html#UVa_10" class="internal_link">UVa_10</a>, and <a href="../../bibliography/index.html#PA_01" class="internal_link">PA_01</a>, respectively. </span></span> In 1956, Charles Feinberg located a handwritten draft of the copyright notice in a Whitman scrapbook in his collection.<span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n4 tei_note_type_authorial note" id="n4"><span>White notes by way of context that "the scrapbook was used by Whitman to keep clippings from newspapers and magazines," and that some items are dated in Whitman's hand: the dates range from 1844 to 1850 (516). </span></span> In research for a short article describing the discovery, William White determined that the document was written in the hand of George F. Betts, a clerk of the Southern District of New York, who processed Whitman's copyright deposit on May 15 (516).
