It includes a transcription of a letter Ralph Waldo Emerson sent to Whitman on July 21, 1855, praising <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. Whitman was so pleased with the letter that he not only showed it to his friends but also allowed Charles A. Dana to print it in the <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi>. The item is pasted down, so an image of the verso is not available.</note>

                <p>"L<hi rend="smallcaps">EAVES OF</hi> G<hi rend="smallcaps">RASS</hi>."&#8212;We some time since had occasion to call the attention of our readers to this original and striking collection of poems, by Mr. Whitman of Brooklyn. In so doing we could not avoid noticing certain faults which seemed to us to be prominent in the work. The following opinion, from a distinguished source, views the matter from a more positive and less critical stand-point:</p>

                            <p>I am not blind to the worth of the wonderful gift of 'Leaves of Grass.' I find it the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed. I am very happy in reading it, as great power makes us happy. It makes the demand I am always making of what seemed the sterile and stingy nature, as if too much handiwork, or too much lymph in the temperament, were making our western wits fat and mean.</p>
                            <p>"I give you joy of your free and brave thought. I have great joy in it. I find incomparable things said incomparably well, as they must be. I find the courage of treatment which so delights us, and which large perception only can inspire.</p>
                            <p>"I greet you at the beginning of a great career, which yet must have had a long foreground somewhere for such a start. I rubbed my eyes a little to see if this sunbeam were no illusion; but the <choice><sic>sold</sic><corr>solid</corr></choice> sense of the book is a sober certainty. It has the best merits, namely, of fortifying and encouraging.</p>
                            <p>"I did not know until I last night saw the book advertised in a newspaper that I could trust the name as real and available for a post-office. I wish to see my benefactor, and have felt much like striking my tasks and visiting New-York to pay you my respects.</p>
