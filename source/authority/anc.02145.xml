                <p>Several surviving documents provide additional information about the deposit of the 1855 <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. Whitman deposited the book in the U.S. copyright office on May 15, 1855. Copies of the deposit title pages for this and later editions of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi> are held in the Rare Books and Special Collections Division at the Library of Congress. Michael Winship has noted that the type used for the deposit title page differed from the type used for the title page in published copies, suggesting the deposit page was printed separately.<note xml:id="n5" type="authorial"><hi rend="italic">Bibliography of American Literature</hi> papers.</note>

                <p>In all but three of the known surviving copies of the 1855 <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>, the copyright notice is printed in two lines on the verso of the title page. One Williams College copy has a blank copyright page; two other copies, now at the University of Virginia and the Providence Athen&#230;um, have the copyright notice written in Whitman's hand.<note xml:id="n3" type="authorial">See <ref target="../../bibliography/index.html#WC_02">WC_02</ref>, <ref target="../../bibliography/index.html#UVa_10">UVa_10</ref>, and <ref target="../../bibliography/index.html#PA_01">PA_01</ref>, respectively.</note> In 1956, Charles Feinberg located a draft of the copyright statement in a Whitman scrapbook in his collection.<note xml:id="n4" type="authorial">White notes by way of context that "the scrapbook was used by Whitman to keep clippings from newspapers and magazines," and that some items are dated in Whitman's hand: the dates range from 1844 to 1850 (516).</note> In research for a short article describing the discovery, William White determined that the document was written in the hand of George F. Betts, a clerk of the Southern District of New York, who processed Whitman's copyright deposit on May 15, 1855 (516).

                <p>White also identified the "Mr. Willmarth" whose name is written on the document in Whitman's hand as "Abel C. Willmarth, an attorney and clerk of the U.S. District Court," who Whitman may have known or gone to see for more information about the deposit (516). No information is currently available about the address, "58 Barclay," written in Whitman's hand on the reverse of the leaf.</p>
