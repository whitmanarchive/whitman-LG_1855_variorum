                <p>A binder's statement written by Charles Jenkins shows copies of the 1855 <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi> bound in several stages.

                    The stages of binding listed in Jenkins's statement include:<note xml:id="n1" type="authorial" resp="#nhg">Information about bindings has been supplemented by a transcription and explanation of this statement in White and summaries in Winship and Myerson.</note> 
                    <list>
                        <item>June 1855: 200 copies at 32 cents each (probably cloth)</item>
                        <item>July 1855: 137 copies at 58 cents each (probably cloth) and 46 copies in "boards mounted" at 18 cents each</item>
                        <item>December 1855: 169 copies in cloth at 22 cents each and 150 copies in paper at 2 cents each</item>
                        <item>January 1856: 93 copies in "cloth plain" at 22 cents each</item>
                    </list></p>
                <p>Bindings in June and July 1855 were probably binding A, with gilt edges and goldstamped ornaments. Cloth bindings in December 1855 and January 1856 were probably binding B, with blindstamped ornaments.<note xml:id="n2" type="authorial" resp="#nhg">This speculation is based on the lower cost of the later bindings and the probable date of the reviews and extracts insertion, which was bound into some copies in bindings B and C. For more about the reviews and extracts, see the <ref target="../intro.html#reviews">introduction to the variorum</ref>. For a complete list of bindings, see Winship and Myerson. Some copies in binding B, probably from the same batch of either December 1855 or January 1856 bindings, feature reversed blind-stamped ornaments in the center of the front and back covers. All copies so far observed to have this ornament reversal also include the eight-page insertion of reviews and extracts that Whitman had printed and bound into some copies. More examination would need to be done of copies with binding B to determine whether this is a consistent phenomenon.</note> Jenkins, a Brooklyn bookbinder, evidently shifted the job to Davies &amp; Hands after the first round of (cloth-bound) copies. Jenkins wrote the following note to Whitman on the statement: "You will see that I have charged you only 32 cts for the Leaves bound by me. The amount of the bill of Davies &amp; Hands over what it would have been at the same price is only about $30. They are not in condition to be able to let their accounts lay uncollected without embarrassment, and my means are invested so that the money is actually needed." Based on this statement, scholars have concluded that 795 was likely the total number of copies printed (White, 353).</p>
