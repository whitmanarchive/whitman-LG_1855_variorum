                <p>Several surviving documents provide additional information about the printing, binding, and deposit of the 1855 <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. A binder's receipt written by Charles Jenkins shows copies bound in several stages.

                    The stages of binding listed in Jenkins's receipt include:<note xml:id="n1" type="authorial" resp="#nhg">Information about bindings has been supplemented by a transcription and explanation of this receipt in White and summaries in Winship and Myerson.</note> 
                    <list>
                        <item>June 1855: 200 copies at 32 cents each (probably cloth)</item>
                        <item>July 1855: 137 copies at 58 cents each (probably cloth) and 46 copies in "boards mounted" at 18 cents each</item>
                        <item>December 1855: 169 copies in cloth at 22 cents each and 150 copies in paper at 2 cents each</item>
                        <item>January 1856: 93 copies in "cloth plain" at 22 cents each</item>
                    </list></p>
                <p>Bindings in June and July 1855 were probably state A, with gilt edges and goldstamped ornaments. Cloth bindings in December 1855 and January 1856 were probably state B, with blindstamped ornaments.<note xml:id="n2" type="authorial" resp="#nhg">This speculation is based on the lower cost of the later bindings and the probable date of the reviews and extracts insertion, which was bound into some state B and state C copies. For more about the reviews and extracts, see the <ref target="../intro.html#reviews">introduction to the variorum</ref>. For a complete list of binding states, see Winship and Myerson. Some copies in state B bindings, probably from the same batch of either December 1855 or January 1856 bindings,  feature reversed blind-stamped ornaments in the center of the front and back covers. Interestingly, all copies so far observed to have this ornament reversal also include the eight-page insertion of reviews and extracts that Whitman had printed and bound into some copies. More examination would need to be done of copies with state B bindings to determine whether this is a consistent phenomenon.</note> Jenkins, a Brooklyn bookbinder, evidently shifted the job to Davies &amp; Hands after the first round of (cloth-bound) copies. Jenkins wrote the following note to Whitman on the receipt: "You will see that I have charged you only 32 cts for the Leaves bound by me. The amount of the bill of Davies &amp; Hands over what it would have been at the same price is only about $30. They are not in condition to be able to let their accounts lay uncollected without embarrassment, and my means are invested so that the money is actually needed." Based on this receipt, scholars have concluded that 795 was likely the total number of copies printed (White, "The First," 353).</p>
                <p>Whitman deposited the book in the U.S. copyright office on May 15, 1855. Copies of the deposit title pages for this and later editions of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi> are held in the Rare Books Department of the Library of Congress. Michael Winship has noted that the type used for the deposit title page differed from the type used for the title page in published copies, suggesting the deposit page was printed separately.

                <p>In all but three of the known surviving copies of the 1855 <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>, the copyright notice is printed in two lines on the verso of the title page. One Williams College copy has a blank copyright page; two other copies, now at the University of Virginia and the Providence Athen&#230;um, have the copyright notice written in Whitman's hand. In 1956, Charles Feinberg located a draft of the copyright statement in a Whitman scrapbook in his collection. In research for a short article describing the discovery, William White determined that the document was written in the hand of George F. Betts, a clerk of the Southern District of New York, who processed Whitman's copyright deposit (White, "More About," 516).

                    <p>White also identified the "Mr. Willmarth" whose name is written on the document in Whitman's hand as "Abel C. Willmarth, an attorney and clerk of the U.S. District Court," who Whitman may have known or gone to see for more information about the deposit ("More About," 516).</p>
