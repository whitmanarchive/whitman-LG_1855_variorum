            <div1 type="section"><p>A number of documents are important to understanding the 1855 <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>, from the binder's receipt and copyright deposit page to a series of draft advertisements Whitman had printed. Here we provide images and a brief discussion of the context and significance of these documents. We also include a note about Whitman's desk copy, now held at the New York Public Library, into which he inserted manuscripts and drafts of material for later editions. In the future, we hope to provide more extensive editorial treatment of these items, including links to transcriptions.</p></div1>

                <p>Several surviving documents relate to the printing, binding, and deposit of the 1855 <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. A binder's receipt written by Charles Jenkins shows copies bound in several stages.

                    The stages of binding listed in Jenkins's receipt include:<note xml:id="n1" type="authorial" resp="#nhg">Information about bindings has been supplemented by a transcription and explanation of this receipt in White and summaries in Winship and Myerson.</note> 
                    <list>
                        <item>June 1855: 200 copies at 32 cents each (probably cloth)</item>
                        <item>July 1855: 137 copies at 58 cents each (probably cloth) and 46 copies in "boards mounted" at 18 cents each</item>
                        <item>December 1855: 169 copies in cloth at 22 cents each and 150 copies in paper at 2 cents each</item>
                        <item>January 1856: 93 copies in "cloth plain" at 22 cents each</item>
                    </list>
                    Bindings in June and July 1855 were probably state A, with gilt edges and goldstamped ornaments. Cloth bindings in December 1855 and January 1856 were probably state B, with blindstamped ornaments.<note xml:id="n2" type="authorial" resp="#nhg">For a complete list of binding states, see Winship and Myerson.</note> Jenkins, a Brooklyn bookbinder, evidently shifted the job to Davies &amp; Hands after the first round of (cloth-bound) copies. Jenkins wrote the following note to Whitman on the receipt: "You will see that I have charged you only 32 cts for the Leaves bound by me. The amount of the bill of Davies &amp; Hands over what it would have been at the same price is only about $30. They are not in condition to be able to let their accounts lay uncollected without embarrassment, and my means are invested so that the money is actually needed." Based on this receipt, scholars have concluded that 795 was likely the total number of copies printed (White, "The First," 353).</p>
                <p>Whitman deposited the book in the U.S. copyright office on May 15, 1855. Michael Winship has noted that the type used for the deposit title page differed from the type used for the title page in published copies.

                <p>In 1956, Charles Feinberg located a draft of the copyright statement printed in most copies of the 1855 <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi> in a Whitman scrapbook in his collection. In research for a short article describing the discovery, William White determined that the document was written in the hand of George F. Betts, a clerk of the Southern District of New York, who processed Whitman's copyright deposit (White, "More About," 516).

                    White also identified the "Mr. Willmarth" whose name is written on the document in Whitman's hand as "Abel C. Willmarth, an attorney and clerk of the U.S. District Court," who Whitman may have known or gone to see for more information about the deposit ("More About," 516).</p>

                <p>A series of prints made of the frontispiece engraving are signed by Whitman in blue pencil. Some of these have been laid into copies of the 1855 <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. The known cases of Whitman using blue pencil were after the publication of the volume, so these signatures may date to the second half of the nineteenth century.</p>

                <p>At some point Whitman arranged for the printing of a series of what probably were intended to be draft advertisements for the 1855 <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. He must have done this while he was still revising the poems, because one of them features draft lines from the first poem in the volume, in later editions titled "Song of Myself." For more about Whitman's lifelong practice of printing slips with poems or prose drafts, see Winship, Grossman, and Stallybrass.</p>
