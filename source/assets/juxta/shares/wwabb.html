 <span id="diff-31105493" class="diff change" juxta:range="36,55" juxta:connect-to="31105492"">LEAVES OF GRASS: (a</span> volume of Poems, just published<span id="diff-31105505" class="diff change" juxta:range="87,89" juxta:connect-to="31105504"">.)</span><br/>
 To give <span id="diff-31105507" class="diff change" juxta:range="99,107" juxta:connect-to="31105506"">judgment</span> on real poems, one needs an account of the poet himself. Very devilish to some, and very divine to some, will appear these new poems, the Leaves of Grass<span id="diff-31105509" class="diff change" juxta:range="261,262" juxta:connect-to="31105508"">:</span> an attempt, as they are, of a live, <span id="diff-31105511" class="diff change" juxta:range="299,304" juxta:connect-to="31105510"">naive</span>, masculine, tenderly affectionate, rowdyish, contemplative, sensual, moral, susceptible and imperious person, to cast into literature not only his own grit and arrogance, but his own flesh and form, undraped, regardless of foreign models, regardless of modesty or law, and ignorant or silently scornful, as at first appears, of all except his own presence and experience, and all outside <span id="diff-31105513" class="diff change" juxta:range="693,695" juxta:connect-to="31105512"">of</span> the fiercely loved land of his birth and the birth of his parents and their parents for several generations before him. Politeness this man has none, and regulation he has none. The effects he produces are no effects of artists or the arts, but effects of the original eye or arm, or the actual atmosphere or <span id="diff-31105515" class="diff change" juxta:range="1005,1013" juxta:connect-to="31105514"">grass or</span> brute or bird. You may feel the unconscious teaching of the presence of some fine animal, but will never feel the teaching of the fine writer or speaker.<br/>
 Other poets celebrate great events, personages, romances, wars, loves, passions, the victories and power of their country, or some real or imagined incident&mdash;and polish their work, and come to conclusions, and satisfy the reader. This poet celebrates himself<span id="diff-31105519" class="diff change" juxta:range="1426,1427" juxta:connect-to="31105518"">:</span> and that is the way he celebrates all. He comes to no conclusions, and does not satisfy the reader. He certainly leaves him what the serpent left the woman and the man, the taste of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, never to be erased again.<br/>
 What good is it to argue about egotism? There can be no two thoughts on Walt Whitman's egotism. That is what he steps out of the crowd and turns and faces them for. Mark, critics! <span id="diff-31105521" class="diff change" juxta:range="1861,1874" juxta:connect-to="31105520"">for otherwise</span> is not used for you the key that leads to the use of the other keys to this <span id="diff-31105525" class="diff change" juxta:range="1951,1965" juxta:connect-to="31105524"">well enveloped</span> yet terribly in earnest man. His whole work, his life, manners, friendships, <span id="diff-31105529" class="diff change" juxta:range="2043,2050" juxta:connect-to="31105528"">writing</span>, all have among their leading purposes, an evident purpose, as <span id="diff-31105531" class="diff change" juxta:range="2114,2120" juxta:connect-to="31105530"">strong</span> and avowed as any of the rest, to stamp a new type of character, namely his own, and indelibly fix it and publish it, not for a model but an illustration, for the present and future of American letters and American young men, for the south the same as the north, and for the Pacific and Mississippi country, and Wisconsin and Texas and<span id="diff-31105533" class="diff change" juxta:range="2456,2456" juxta:connect-to="31105532""></span> Canada and Havana, just as much as <span id="diff-31105537" class="diff change" juxta:range="2492,2500" juxta:connect-to="31105536"">New York</span> and Boston. Whatever is needed toward this achievement he puts his hand to, and lets imputations take their time to die.<br/>
 First be yourself what you would show in your poem&mdash;such seems to be this man's example and inferred rebuke to the schools of poets. He makes no allusions to books or writers; their spirits do not seem to have touched him; he has not a word to say for or against them, or their theories or ways. He never offers others; what he continually offers is the man whom our Brooklynites know so well. Of pure American breed, of reckless health, his body perfect, free from taint from top to toe, free forever from headache and dyspepsia, full-blooded, six feet high, a good feeder, never once using medicine, drinking water only&mdash;a swimmer in the river or bay or by the <span id="diff-31105541" class="diff change" juxta:range="3284,3292" juxta:connect-to="31105540"">seashore</span>&mdash;of

juxta:connect-to="31105556"">and indulgence</span> toward men and women, and of one who finds the same returned many fold&mdash;a face with two gray eyes where passion and hauteur sleep, and

who has firm attachments there, and associates there&mdash;one who does not associate with literary and elegant people&mdash;one of the two men sauntering along the street with their arms over each <span id="diff-31105575" class="diff change" juxta:range="4514,4519" juxta:connect-to="31105574"">other</span>'<span id="diff-31105577" class="diff change" juxta:range="4520,4521"

from the <span id="diff-31105583" class="diff change" juxta:range="4588,4600" juxta:connect-to="31105582"">hunting-tent</span> or lumber-raft&mdash;one who has that quality of attracting the best out

sweetest and most generous traits&mdash;a man never called upon to make speeches at public dinners, never on platforms amid the crowds of clergymen or professors or aldermen or congressmen&mdash;rather down in the bay with pilots in their <span id="diff-31105589" class="diff change" juxta:range="4990,5001" juxta:connect-to="31105588"">pilot boats</span>&mdash;or off on a

streets of the city or the open grounds of the country&mdash;fond of New York and Brooklyn&mdash;fond of the life of the wharves and the great ferries, or along Broadway, observing the endless wonders of that thoroughfare of the world&mdash;<span id="diff-31105597" class="diff change" juxta:range="5321,5324" juxta:connect-to="31105596"">one</span> whom, if you would meet, you need not expect to meet an extraordinary person&mdash;one in whom you will see the singularity which consists in no singularity&mdash;whose contact is no dazzling fascination, nor requires any deference, but has the easy fascination of what is homely and accustomed&mdash;of something you knew before, and was waiting for&mdash;of natural pleasures, and well-known places, and welcome familiar faces&mdash;perhaps of a remembrance of your brother or mother, or friend away or dead&mdash;<span id="diff-31105599" class="diff change" juxta:range="5805,5810" juxta:connect-to="31105598"">there</span> you have Walt
